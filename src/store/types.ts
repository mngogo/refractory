/**
 * For simplicty's sake, we keep these separate from SlateJS types, since SlateJS has some
 * fairly generous type definitions (e.g. allowing [key: string]: unknown) and we can narrow
 * our types down and use them in and around the program.
 * 
 * Also prefix them with T since there's a lot of overlap with both Slate types and browser builtins.
