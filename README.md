# Refractory

An experiment in trying to make a low SLOC, but decent editor based on MutationObserver and contenteditable.

## Goals

- Support markdown-ish content in a rich text editing fashion
- Keep it relatively small
- Producing sensible HTML output

## Non goals

- Being a highly extensible editor framework
- Supporting Markdown or any other standard exactly as written

## How to use in your own projects

Right now just copy the files from src/; it's not npm-ready
